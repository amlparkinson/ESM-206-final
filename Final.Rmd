***Figure 1:** Flipper lengths (mm) and body mass (g) by sex of three penguin species in Antarctica - ![Gentoo] (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/409c808f8fc9899d02401bdb04580af7), ![Chinstrap] (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/2b1cff60f81640f182433d23e68541ce), and ![Adelie] (https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/abc50eed9138b75f54eaada0841b9b86) penguins. Data: Palmer Station LTER.*

General trends from Figure 1:

- Male penguins appear to have higher body mass and slightly longer flipper lengths than females across all three species. 
- Gentoo penguins have the highest body mass and longest flipper length than Chinstrap and Adelie penguins.

The adjusted R^2^ evaluates model fit, but has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model.

### Task 2: Smoking effects on baby birth weight

```{r}
# load data and only keep tpounds, lowbw, and smoke columns

birthweights <- read_csv('nc_birthweights.csv') %>% 
  select (tpounds, lowbw, smoke) %>% 
  drop_na(smoke)

```


***Table 2:** Data was collected on babies classified birthweight (low or not) and whther or not the mother smoked during pregnancy. 1,000 babies from North Carolina were randomly selected for the study.*
```{r}
# table: Does the proportion of babies born at “low birth weight” differ depending on whether the mother smoked or did not smoke during pregnancy

# step 1: create sub data

birthweights_table_data <- birthweights %>% 
  group_by(smoke) %>% 
  count(lowbw) %>% 
  mutate(low_birth_weight = case_when( 
         lowbw == 1 ~ "Yes",
         lowbw == 0 ~ "No")) %>% 
  mutate("Mother Smoke?" = case_when(
    smoke == 1 ~"Yes",
    smoke == 0 ~"No"
  )) %>% 
  ungroup(smoke) %>% 
  select(-lowbw, -smoke)

# step 2 create contigency  table

birthweights_table_counts <- birthweights_table_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = low_birth_weight, values_from = n) 

birthweights_table_proportions <- birthweights_table_counts %>% 
  adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits=1) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")

# step 3: R markdown friendly contigency table with counts and proportions

birthweights_table_proportions %>% 
  kable (col.names = c("Mother Smoke?", "No", "Yes")) %>%
  add_header_above(c(" "= 1, "Low Birthweight?"=2)) %>% 
  #add_header_above(c("North Carolina babies: Does mother smoking affect baby's birthweight?"=3)) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
    full_width=F,
    position="center") %>% 
  column_spec(1, width='4cm') %>%  #control column 1's row width
  column_spec(2, width="8em") %>% 
  column_spec(3, width="8em")


```

```{r, include = F}
# statistically significant difference between the proportion of babies born at low birth weights for smoking vs. non-smoking mothers? 

# H null: there is no difference in birthweights of babies from mothers who did and did not smoke
# H alt : there is a difference in birthweights of babies from mothers who did and did not smoke

# step 1: get cocntigency table of just counts
birthweight_counts <- birthweights_table_counts %>% 
  column_to_rownames('Mother Smoke?')           

# step 2: run chi-square test
birthweights_chi <- chisq.test(birthweight_counts)
birthweights_chi

# p = 0.2696
```

A Pearson's chi-squared test was performed to examine whether or not babies with low birthweights are independent of having mothers who smoked during pregnancy. The results from our test found that babies with low bithweights are independent of mothers smoking during pregnancy ($\chi$^2^(`r birthweights_chi$parameter`) = `r round(birthweights_chi$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round(birthweights_chi$p.value,2)`). 

To improve future surveys, researchers might consider changing the "smoking during pregnancy" category from binomial (yes or no) to a ordinal response (frequently, sometimes, rarely, never). Some women might have smoked once or twice throughout their pregnancy, while others might have smoked every day, or some other frequency. Mothers who smoked once or twice may not have as much of an effect on their babies birthweight than mothers who smoked frequently, so researchers would want to distinguish between these differences if there are any.


### Task 3: Visualizing UCSB campus profiles

In this section, I will explore the undergraduate enrollment rates of minorities at University of California, Santa barbara across all years of available data (2008-2019). Enrollment rates of whites, others, and unknowns were excluded from the analysis and some ethnicities were combined into similar groups (Filipinos were combined with Asian and Pacific Islanders, Chicanos and Latinos were combined into a new group called Hispanics).

***Figure x:** Annual undergraduate enrollment rates of minorities and underrepresented groups at University of California, Santa Barbara. Years are based on a school calendar year which starts in September of one year and ends in June of the following year. Data: ![UCSB] (http://bap.ucsb.edu/institutional.research/campus.profiles/)*


General takeways from Figure x:

- Line graphs with groups that have large differences in numbers (Hispanics and Asian/Pacific Islander compared to African Americans, E. Indian/Pakistani, and American Indian/Alaskan) can result in incorrectly misinterpreting  information minorities have had the largest growth in undergradutes.
- While it appears that the enrollment for the other three minorities has been relatively stagnant, African American enrollment has almost doubled and East Indian and Pakistani enrollment has increased by 226% since 2008-2009 school year. American Indian and Alaskan enrollment has very similar percent change: 52% and 54% respectively.    


### Task 4: Purple urchins on the Santa Barbara coast

    site %in% c("IVEE") ~ "Isla Vista",
    site %in% c("AQUE") ~ "Arroyo Quemado",
    site %in% c("MOHK") ~ "Mohawk", 
    site %in% c("NAPL") ~ "Naples")) %>% 
  mutate(year=as.character(year))

```

```{r, include = F}

# summary statistics for urchin sizes at the 5 different sites

urchin_stats <- urchin %>% 
  group_by(site) %>% 
  summarize (mean = mean(size, na.rm=T),
             sd = sd(size, na.rm=T),
             se = sd((size) / sqrt(n()), na.rm=T),

    bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), 
    full_width=T,
    position="center") 


```
maybe choose a different graph? -> yes ,make a graph with measures of uncertainty (sd, se)
```{r, include = F}
# exploratory graphs of purple urchin size distributions at each site

ggplot (urchin, aes(x=size)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill=site), show.legend=F) +
  labs ( x= '\nSize (?)',

        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5))



```



Observations of exploratory graphs:

- Distribution of sizes appears to be normal for all five sites.
- There is a large sample size for all sites, so it is unlikely that all urchins at the sites fall within these bounds. These gaps in the graph are likely due to sampling error --> check metadata

```{r, include = F}
# is there a significant difference in mean purple urchin size in control treatments at the 5 sites

# H null: there is no significant difference in mean purple urchin size in control treatments at the 5 sites
# H alt: there is a significant difference in mean purple urchin size in control treatments at the 5 sites

# anova
urchin_aov <- aov(size ~ site, data=urchin)
summary(urchin_aov)
# p<2e-16

# tukey
urchin_tukey <- TukeyHSD(urchin_aov)
urchin_tukey

# results: all sites have a significant difference except for 

# To report your one-way ANOVA, need to unlist the outcomes isla vista and carpenteria

urchin_outputs <- unlist(summary(urchin_aov))
urchin_outputs

# Create a data frame of Tukey to reference p-values through in-line referencing

df <- data.frame(urchin_tukey$site)
df
```

To determine whether or not there is a difference in total mean sizes for purple urchins (*Strongylocentrotus purpuratus*) found in five different sites along the Santa Barbara coast, a one-way ANOVA test was performed. The results  F(`r urchin_outputs[1]`, `r urchin_outputs[2]`) = `r round(urchin_outputs[7],2)`, *p* = `r round(urchin_outputs[9],3)`) indicate that there is a significant difference between at least two of the mean sizes for purple urchins in different sites A Tukey's HSD post-hoc test was performed to determine which sites had significant differences between total mean sizes. The results show that there is a significant difference in all but one pairwise comparison: total mean sizes between purple urchins in Isla Vista (`r round(urchin_stats$mean[3], 2)`g $\pm$ `r round(urchin_stats$sd[3], 2)`g)(mean $\pm$ SD) and Carpinteria (`r round(urchin_stats$mean[2], 2)`g $\pm$ `r round(urchin_stats$sd[2], 2)`g)(mean $\pm$ SD) (*p* = `r round(df$p.adj[5],3)`). 


mohawk: (`r round(urchin_stats$mean[4], 2)`g $\pm$ `r round(urchin_stats$sd[4], 2)`g) 
naples: (`r round(urchin_stats$mean[5], 2)`g $\pm$ `r round(urchin_stats$sd[5], 2)`g)
arroyo Quemado (`r round(urchin_stats$mean[1], 2)`g $\pm$ `r round(urchin_stats$sd[1], 2)`g)

The actual differences in mean weights between channel types was 1.78 grams between pools and cascades and 1.84 grams between side channels and cascades. These differences were significantly lower than the difference between pools and side channles, which was 3.62 grams (about 50% higher than the other mean differences).
